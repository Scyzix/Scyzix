- Hi, I am @Scyzix, but you can call me Scyzix or Phuc. I am a young Vietnamese technologist, currently learning in Secondary School, and is 14 years old.
- I am a dedicated technologist with a passion for innovation and continuous growth. Early in my journey, I was deeply immersed in video games and movies, experiences that ignited an initial dream of becoming one of the top 10 developers globally. Although I once struggled with balancing my interests, those formative times provided invaluable insights and helped shape the professional I am today.
- At present, my focus is on developing an ambitious UAV project. Despite its complexity, this project stands as a testament to my perseverance and my willingness to dive deep into challenging environments. Every setback and breakthrough in this journey has enriched my knowledge across IT, artificial intelligence, physics, and mathematics, establishing a solid foundation for my future endeavors.
- Looking ahead, my immediate goal is to gain admission to a specialized educational program that aligns with my passion. Following that, I plan to pursue higher education to further hone my skills and expand my expertise. Ultimately, my aspiration is to become a leading Robotics Developer and Artificial Intelligence Scientist, roles that challenge me to continuously innovate and contribute meaningfully to society. I also remain committed to supporting others in their journeys, sharing insights and fostering a collaborative spirit among peers.
